Hello!

Not only am I unplugged and on vacation, but so is my laptop. Why? Well, because you can save on your electric bill while also reducing your environmental impact if you shut down your laptop. I can’t respond to you if the planet’s gone! But don’t fret - I’ll be back [Return Date].

Happy unplugging!
