Hello there,

Sometimes we all need to <a href="https://medium.com/@HubSpot/take-a-break-763b6cd79982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take a break</a>. Even when we're working remotely. That's why you won't find me checking email until I return to my home office on [Return Date]. If you’re also looking to take a break, consider these <a href="https://www.thezerowastecollective.com/post/zero-waste-travel-a-how-to-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainable travel tips</a> so that we’re not only taking care of ourselves, but our planet.

Thanks,
