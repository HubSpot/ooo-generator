Hello!

I’m taking a break in [Destination] to rest, recharge and [Activity]. But, that’s not all. I’m taking a sustainable break. Here’s how:

Unplugged my computer to save energy
Took the scenic route instead of a plane to cut down on my carbon footprint
Brought my own water bottle, coffee mug, and food storage bags

I’ll be returning on [Return Date] and will respond to you then. In the meantime, I hope you’ll consider ways to make your own vacations more sustainable.
