Oh, this is awkward: You’ve caught me away from my desk. _The crowd gasps_.

I’m in [Destination] until [Return Date], and I know I’m supposed to say I have limited access to email but the truth is, the WiFi works just fine here #SorryNotSorry. I’m just focusing on [Activity] instead of my inbox. Once I’m back from my holiday, I look forward to embracing WiFi again and following up with you. (After the post-vacation blues, of course.)

If someone is really, truly, desperately urgent, please reach out to [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email]. Thanks!
