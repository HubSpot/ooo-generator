Hi there, thanks for your email. Unfortunately (or not, if you’re me), I’m on vacation in [Destination] until [Return Date]. And before you get jealous, I have something that will help your office blues. Please enjoy this relaxing, 10-hour YouTube video of ocean waves. You’ll feel like you’re on the sandy beaches of Hawaii! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHPEKLQID4U
