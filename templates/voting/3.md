Hello!

You seem to have missed me. Hmm, where could I be?

Skiing in the Alps
Relaxing at the beach
Jamming to patriotic tunes
Voting at my local polling place

The answer’s D, but honestly C is also true. You’ve got to set the mood.

Contact [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email] if this is an urgent matter. Otherwise, I’ll get back to you shortly! 

Until then, duty calls.
