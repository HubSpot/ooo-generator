Hello there! 

I’m sorry to miss your email, but what I’m doing today is kind of important ⁠— I’m taking time off to vote.

Now I love a good vote: best movie of the decade, coolest superpower, most rocking band name.

But today’s vote is more important than all of those. I’m voting in elections that will help influence the future of my country. (Aha, coolest superpower - found it!)

If your question is urgent, please contact [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email]. Otherwise, I’ll respond to you when I return.


Sincerely,
[First Name] [Last Name]
