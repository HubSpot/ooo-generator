Hi there,

I use my voice every day at work ⁠— in video chats, phone calls, the awesome emails that I write (like this one).

Today, though, I’m using my voice for something different. Today, I’m voting.

I might be voting in person, or by mail. I might be filling in a bubble, pressing a button, or leaving my fingerprint on a page. And I might be leaving with an ‘I Voted’ sticker or just a sense of pride (but you better believe if there’s a sticker I’ll be wearing it all day).

Whatever voting looks like for me today, I’m using my voice to help determine the future of my country. 

I can’t think of a better reason to miss your email.

(No fear, I’ll be back tomorrow).

If you can’t wait until then, feel free to email [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email].

Best,
[First Name] [Last Name]
