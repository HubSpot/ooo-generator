Hey there!

I’m out of the office today. Know why? 

I’m out of the office to help decide who gets to be in <i>the office</i>. The Oval Office, that is.

Exciting stuff, huh? I get to use my voice to influence the future of my democracy… and possibly snag an awesome “I Voted” sticker along the way.

If this is an emergency and can’t wait until tomorrow, please email [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email], although chances are they’re taking time off today for the same reason I am. 

See you (and the results!) tomorrow!

[First Name] [Last Name]
