Hello,

You’ve reached the inbox of [First Name] [Last Name]. They’re unable to respond to your email right now because they’re currently in the thick of holiday shopping. And, if you’ve ever seen Love Actually, you know how long gift wrapping can take (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3rB_qx0wRM), so [First Name] won’t be back until [Return Date]. Until they return from the nightmare of Toyland, give [ER Contact Name] a jingle at [ER Contact Email]. 

Happy Holidays! 
[First Name] [Last Name]
