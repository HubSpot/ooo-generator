Season’s Greetings!

I am currently curled up on the couch with fuzzy slippers on and a mug of hot cocoa in hand. There’s a fire playing on my TV and I’m [Activity]. It’s safe to say, I won’t be getting up to answer your email, question on Slack, or saying yes to your calendar invite until [Return Date]. 

If it’s an emergency - like the colored lights won’t turn on, or you forgot your shovel outside before it began to snow, tweet me using the hashtag #SureFeelsLikeTheHolidays and I’ll respond with some quick, actionable tips. 

If your emergency has to do with work, please reach out to the esteemed [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email] or I’ll get back to you once I return to the office (potentially with my fuzzy slippers still on). 

Cheers!
[First Name] [Last Name]
