Hi there,

I’m out of the office from [Leave Date] until [Return Date] in [Destination] doing nothing but [Activity].  

But I have to admit, your email caught me off guard. It’s the holiday season, after all. Offices are empty. Desks are collecting dust. Mail is building up. Personally, I’m not sure I’d know how to use Excel right now if it hit me in the face. 

Alas, you’re a hard worker. (Or hopefully, you have a big, long, relaxing vacation right around the corner.) So if you need a response sooner than later, please reach out to [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email].

Happy holidays!
[First Name]
