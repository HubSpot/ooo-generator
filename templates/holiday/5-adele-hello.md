Hello, it’s me. I’ve been wondering if after all these emails you’d like to meet. To go over, everything. They say the holidays are meant to chill you out, but I ain’t done much chillin’.

Hello, can you hear me? I’m in [Destination] until [Return Date] dreaming about the most wonderful time of year. Even if you call a thousand times, I won’t be answering as I will be busy doing [Activity]. 

At least you can say you’ve tried. 

If this is urgent, please try [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email]. 

Goodbye from the other side. 
[First Name]
