‘Tis the season for receiving an out of office email. But instead of the generic “limited access to wifi” message (hello, it’s the 21st century) I thought I’d share my holiday plans with you because if we just so happen to be friends on Facebook, you’ll probably be seeing the photos I post with all the wifi I have anyways.

I’ll be enjoying the holidays this year in [Destination] starting [Leave Date]. While I’m here, I’ll be [Activity] with my loved ones during this magical time of year. 

If this is an emergency and can’t wait until I return on [Return Date], please email [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email], although chances are they are spending time with friends and family as well, and I hope you can do the same. 

You can most likely expect a response from me...next year. (That joke never gets old to me.)

Have a wonderful holiday season,
[First Name] [Last Name]
