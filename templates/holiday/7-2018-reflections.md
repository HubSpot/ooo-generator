Oh hello there, 

It seems you’ve reached me at a bad time. See, I’m away from the office in [Destination] from [Leave Date] until [Return Date]. And because it’s nearing the end of another year, I’m doing a lot of reflecting while I’m away. 

For example, I really regret not taking more time off this year. Vacation is good for the soul, but there’s just never a good time to take it. I guess that’s why over 700 million vacation days went unused in the U.S. in 2017. That’s right, MILLION.

That’s why I’m using this time in [Destination] for unplugging, relaxing, and [Activity]. (Oh and listening to holiday music, of course.) 

If your message is urgent, please reach out to [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email]. 
Happy unplugging!
[First Name]
