Snow day! Snow day! We have a snow day!

While kids are outside building snowmen and sledding, I will be shoveling out of our wintery fortress and [Activity]. Who knows how long the task will take, but you can expect me to be gone from [Leave Date] until [Return Date]. 

In case of emergency (other than this snow emergency), please email [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email]. 

From the inside of a snowglobe,
