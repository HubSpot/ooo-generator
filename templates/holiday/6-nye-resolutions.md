Hello, 

Did you know that the most common New Year’s resolution is to exercise more? Lucky for me, I’m anything but common. I actually plan to exercise less next year, starting right now. 

I’m currently out of office from [Leave Date] to [Return Date] in [Destination]. And there’s a lot to do in [Destination], but I’m most interested in cozying up on the couch, enjoying some hot cocoa (with whole milk!), and [Activity]. 

Why? Because my New Year’s resolution this year is YOLO.

What’s yours? (Wait, don’t tell me, you’ll get another autoresponder.)

I’ll follow up when I’m back, and if you need quick help, please reach out to [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email]. 

Have a happy holiday season!
