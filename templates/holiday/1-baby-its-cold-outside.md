I really can’t stay… (because I’m out of office right now.)
I gotta go away… (I’ll be gone from [Leave Date] to [Return Date])
This evening has been so very nice… (in [Destination])
Maybe it’s cold outside….(wherever you are right now.)
But really I’d better scurry… (and get to my [Activity].) 
And if you start to worry… (contact [ER Contact Name])
But only if you’re pacing the floor… (email them at [ER Contact Email])
I simply must go… (But I’ll respond when I return.)
And if it’s cold outside…. Enjoy this rendition of Michael Buble’s Baby It’s Cold Outside (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bbuBubZ1yE)
