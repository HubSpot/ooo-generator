Hi there, thanks for your email. Unfortunately (or not, if you’re me), I’m on vacation from [Leave Date] until [Return Date]. And before you get jealous, I have something that will help your office blues. Please enjoy this 10-hour video loop of a crackling fireplace: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY3J3Y_OU0w

If that doesn’t put you in the holiday spirit (or to sleep), I don’t what will.

In case your message is urgent, please contact [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email]. 
All the best!
[First Name]
