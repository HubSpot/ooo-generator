Hello, 

I know you may be upset that I’m on vacation in [Destination] until [Return Date] and you’re not. I don’t blame you, or discount your feelings. But, let’s be real for a second. Everyone knows that the holiday season in the office means daily baked goods, wearing ridiculous ugly sweaters that jingle, swapping gifts, and listening to the best tunes of the season. So, bring some cheer to the office while I’m out, and enjoy these top seasonal hits for a quick escape to a winter wonderland: 

Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!, Frank Sinatra
Baby It's Cold Outside, Idina Menzel & Michael Bublé 
Winter Wonderland, Elvis Presley 
December '63, The Four Seasons (Okay, not really a winter song, but it’s a great one) 
Ice, Ice Baby, Vanilla Ice (I know, it’s a stretch, but had to) 

When the music stops (figuratively and literally), email [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email] for a timely reply.

Cheers! 
[First Name]
