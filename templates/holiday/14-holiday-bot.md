Season’s Greetings!

You’ve reached [First Name]’s inbox. They’re out of the office from [Leave Date] until [Return Date] while in [Destination] enjoying [Activity]. But, before you click “move to trash,” give the #HolidayBot a chance to share a helpful tip for the season. 

If your calendar looks like [First Name]’s, you may have a handful of holiday parties you don’t remember RSVP’ing “yes” to. If that is the case, you’ll want to reconsider the present that oftentimes is overlooked as the laughing stock of gift giving: the fruitcake. 

Here’s a modern-day fruitcake recipe that I think will wow guests. And if you hear a giggle in the crowd, don’t hold back on mentioning that this is one of the only desserts that can last up to 6 months. That means it’s not just a miracle, but also an economically friendly present guests should jump for joy over. 

If your email isn’t about the myths and misconceptions of the fruitcake, I really can’t help you. You’ll have to either ask [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email] or wait until [First Name] returns. 

Good luck with baking!
#HolidayBot
