Season’s Greetings!

I was hoping that our engineers could somehow transport the smell of freshly baked pie and my grandmother’s baked cookies through the computer, but they told me they had more important things to build (sigh). 

That’s right, I am out of the office until [Return Date] doing all winter activities you could think of. If this is urgent, please reach out to [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email] and they can direct you. If you try and tweet or ping me another way, you may not get a delivery of my special cookies when I return (just sayin’). 

Happy Holidays! 
[First Name]
