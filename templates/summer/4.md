Did you know that most people in the US only use about 51% of their paid time off? 

Well, I am not most people. I give everything 100%. EVERYTHING. Work, friends, family, my Netflix shows, you name it. And I plan to give my vacation days 100% which is why I’m on vacation in [Destination] until [Return Date]. If you need me before then, I’m sorry but I’ll be 100% dedicated to [Activity]. 

Feel free to reach out to [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email] if it’s an emergency. Thank you, and as always, keep it 100.
