Okay okay, I know what you might be thinking. 

[First Name]’s on vacation and I’m not. You might be jealous, or even angry. And I don’t blame you. I’m in [Destination] until [Return Date], doing nothing but [Activity], while you’re probably preparing for a big meeting or writing a project summary. 

But mind over matter, my friend. Book a conference room, put on your headphones, close your eyes, and enjoy these top summer hits for a quick escape:
- Summer Looks Good On You, Cheap Trick
- Kokomo, Beach Boys
- Summer Girls, LFO
- Paradise City, Guns N’ Roses
- Walking on Sunshine, Katrina & The Waves

When the music stops (figuratively and literally), email [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email] for a timely reply.
