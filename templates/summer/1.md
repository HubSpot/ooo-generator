Hi, you’ve reached [First Name][last name]’s ghost of vacations past. I’ll make sure your email gets read and responded to when they’re back at work on [Return Date]. But for now, it’s my job to make sure they unplug while they’re away in [Destination]. After all, a history of unrelaxing vacations can be a scary thing.

If it’s urgent, reach out to [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email] - I’m not scheduled to haunt them until later this year. Thank you and have a boo-tiful day!
