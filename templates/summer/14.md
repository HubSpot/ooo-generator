Thanks for your email. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to read it or think about it until [Return Date] when I’m back from my vacation in [Destination]. In the meantime, I’ll be using that brain power to think about:
- A witty caption for my upcoming feet-in-the-sand Instagram post
- If the couple from the Piña Coladas song ended up together in the end
- The perfect gift to bring back to [ER Contact Name], who you should email if you need a timely response at [ER Contact Email]
