Hello, it’s me, vacation-[First Name].

People often confuse me and [First Name], but we are actually quite different. [First Name] proofreads everything...twice. Vacation-[First Name] proofreads murder mystery novels and cooking magazines. [First Name] worries about deadlines. Vacation-[First Name] worries about squeezing a nap in before dinner. [First Name] gets nervous about speaking up in a meeting. Vacation-[First Name] gets nervous the karaoke machine will run out of songs.

I’ll be back to my old self on [Return Date], but for now, vacation-[First Name] is running the show in [Destination]. If your message is timely, reach out to [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email].
