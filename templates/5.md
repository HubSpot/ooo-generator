Hi there, thanks for your email!

I’m out of office until [Return Date], in [Destination] enjoying [Activity]. I’ll follow up with you as soon as I can when I’m back at work. In case of an emergency*, please email [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email]. 

Have a great day,
[First Name]

*Emergency can be defined as:
- ‘The Bachelorette’ returned my phone call and they LOVED my audition tape
- They’ve replaced salted almonds with unsalted almonds (i.e. no salt) in the office kitchen
- I was tagged in an unflattering photo on Facebook
- You won the lottery and need someone to split the winnings with because it’s simply too much money for one person
