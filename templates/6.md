If you’re reading this email, I thank you for coming this far. Now, I’d like to invite you to go a little further….

If you need to reach me, travel to [Destination] where I’ll be on vacation until [Return Date]. There, on the highest peak, of the tallest mountain, you’ll find a small house with a red door. Open the door. Inside the house, you’ll meet a kind, old man who will give you a flower. When you understand that flower, you’ll know how to truly reach me.

For those of you not willing to take the journey, please wait until my return or email [ER Contact Name] at [ER Contact Email].
