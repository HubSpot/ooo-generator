### Installation & Setup

* Install Gatsby CLI: `npm install --global gatsby-cli`
* Install project packages: `make install`

### Routine

* Run locally: `make develop`
* Push: if you're reading this, you already have access to the repo, so PR away!
* Deploy: `make deploy` after your PR is merged into `master`
  * If anyone wants to setup CI integration or auto-deploys that is ðŸ’¯
  * To learn more about this setup, checkout the [gatsby docs on using with GH pages](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/)

### Project layout

* `public`: this is the build dir. you mostly can ignore
* `src/components/screens`: there are multiple main "screens" which are full-width by full-height, so each of those is setup as a page in this directory
* `src/components/style`: components which are mainly just styled-components CSS wrappers
* `src/components/*.js`: general purpose reusable components
* `src/layouts`: only one layout, used to fetch static metadata to feed to other compoennts, and to configure things like the `<head />` config and attributes
* `src/pages`: since this only has one "page" in the classical sense, there is one main page: `index.js` which imports all other page components and lays them out
* `static/`: files to be included in output untouched by webpack. See [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-images-fonts-files/#using-the-code-classlanguage-textstaticcode-folder).
