Most commonly\n\t * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n\t * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n\t *\n\t * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n\t * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n\t * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n\t * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n\t *\n\t * const duration = 300;\n\t *\n\t * const defaultStyle = {\n\t *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n\t *   opacity: 0,\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * const transitionStyles = {\n\t *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n\t *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n\t * };\n\t *\n\t * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n\t *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n\t *     {(state) => (\n\t *       <div style={{\n\t *         ...defaultStyle,\n\t *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n\t *       }}>\n\t *         I'm a fade Transition!\n\t *       </div>\n\t *     )}\n\t *   </Transition>\n\t * );\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n\t * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n\t * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n\t *\n\t * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n\t *  - `'entering'`\n\t *  - `'entered'`\n\t *  - `'exiting'`\n\t *  - `'exited'`\n\t *\n\t * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n\t * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n\t * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n\t * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * state = { in: false };\n\t *\n\t * toggleEnterState = () => {\n\t *   this.setState({ in: true });\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * render() {\n\t *   return (\n\t *     <div>\n\t *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n\t *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n\t *     </div>\n\t *   );\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n\t * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\n\t *\n\t * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n\t *\n\t * ## Timing\n\t *\n\t * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\n\t * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\n\t * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\n\t * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\n\t * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\n\t *\n\t * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\n\t * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\n\t * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n\t * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable.

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {(state) => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * state = { in: false };\n *\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n *\n * ## Timing\n *\n * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\n * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\n * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\n * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\n * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\n *\n * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\n * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\n * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable. For example, even though\n * > classes `example-enter` and `example-enter-active` are applied immediately one after\n * > another, you can still transition from one to the other because of the forced reflow\n * > (read [this issue](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/issues/159#issuecomment-322761171)\n * > for more info).

Subsequent\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n * invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?
